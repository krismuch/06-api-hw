To better understand weather patterns around the eqautor, current weather data from a sample of roughly 500 cities was used to look at relationships between latitude and four weather factors--temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. Note the equator's latitude is equal to 0 and the farther away from 0 (in either a neagtive or positive direction), the farther you are from the equator. We observed the following: 

1. Temperatures are hottest the closest you are to the equator. The coldest temperatures are observed at the extreme latitudes (-60 and 60+). 

2. Temperatures are warmer in the latitudes 10 to 40 than they are at -10 to -40, even though they are the same distance from the equator. This is because the northern hemisphere is currently experiencing summer, whereas the southern hemisphere is currently experiencing winter. The opposite would be observed six months from now. 

3. Humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed are not related to latitude.
